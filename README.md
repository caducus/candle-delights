Approach / Functionality
________________________________________________________________________________

Candle deLights was designed to be accessible by anyone; we wanted users to be able to access the application from computer browsers as well as their mobile options. We used drop down menu's to allow users to easily select their candle ingredient options to create a final product that they can add to their list. Once added, we added features like "edit" and "delete" so that users have the flexibility to tweak their inventions or to dwindle their list if it gets too long.
